<h1>Spica C++ Components</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Please read the <a href="overview.html">overview document</a> for general information about the
  Spica C++ library, how it is organized, and its design goals. I've recently started to document
  this library using embedded comments and <a
      href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a>. The documentation in this form is currently very
  incomplete, but eventually it will be the primary way this library is documented. <a
      href="api/index.html">Here is what I have so far</a>.</p>

<p>One of the design goals of this library is to keep the individual components as independent as
  possible. You shouldn't have to commit yourself to the entire library just to use a single
  component. Each component has an associated list of required files. To use a component, you only
  need the files mentioned in the list.</p>

<p>Some components use platform-specific code. The library detects various platforms at compile
  time using preprocessor macros in <b>environ.hpp</b>. Then, depending on what is found, various
  macros specific to the library are set to appropriate values. Any component that uses
  platform-specific techniques includes environ.hpp and uses these macros to verify the platform
  or conditionally compile the proper code. By using this approach, all platform-specific macros
  are managed in a single file. Should the library come to support a new platform, it might only
  be necessary, in some cases, to edit <kbd>environ.h</kbd>.</p>

<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>

<p>It is my intention for all containers to have a style that is consistent with the containers in
  the C++ standard library to the greatest degree possible. This will make the Spica containers
  easier to learn and use in combination with standard library algorithms and other "well-known"
  techniques. Alas, not all the containers are equally evolved in this regard.</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p><b>class template BinomialHeap</b></p>

    <p>A binomial heap is a data structure that offers fast insertion, lookup of the minimum item,
      <em>and</em> fast merging of two heaps. See the documentation for more information.</p>

    <p>Files: <kbd>BinomialHeap.hpp</kbd>. A very minimal test program is in <kbd>BinomialHeap_tests.cpp</kbd>.
      This test program is in need of much enhancement.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b><a href="FileVector.html">class template FileVector</a></b></p>

    <p>A FileVector is a vector-like object that allows you to treat the contents of a file like a
      vector. This implementation is a template so that file vector elements can be of various
      types (with some restrictions). The current implementation only works for Windows, but it
      should be possible to implement this template on any system that supports memory-mapped
      files.</p>

    <p>Files: <kbd>FileVector.hpp</kbd>. A simple demonstration program is in <kbd>FileVector_tests.cpp</kbd>.
      It should be enhanced into a general purpose vector testing template.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b>class RexxString</b></p>

    <p>The Spica string class implements strings in a manner similar to that supported by the Rexx
      programming language. The implementation uses reference counting (copy on demand) to support
      fast effective copying. This class is exception safe in the sense that an operation either
      works correctly or leaves its RexxString operands unchanged. This class is also thread safe
      in the sense described in the documentation (see the comments in the source file).</p>

    <p>Files: <kbd>RexxString.hpp</kbd> and <kbd>RexxString.cpp</kbd>. If you need to use this
      component in a multithreaded program, you will also need <kbd>synchronize.hpp</kbd>, <kbd>synchronize.cpp</kbd>,
      and <kbd>environ.hpp</kbd>. I have created a test program named str_tests.cpp that you can
      use to exercise this class. I suggest at least compiling the test program and running all
      the tests before trying to use this class in your own programs. The file str_testsMT.cpp
      attempts to exercise this class in a multithreaded environment. The multithreaded testing
      that is done is currently quite minimal.</p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b>class template WorkQueue</b></p>

    <p>This class template is a solution to the classic producer/consumer problem for multiple
      threads in a single process. One (or more) producer threads can add items to a WorkQueue
      while one (or more) consumer threads remove those items. This template synchronizes those
      operations so that race conditions are prevented. It is exception safe in that if a queue
      operation throws an exception, the counters and locks maintained by the queue are left in a
      correct state. It also differs from low-level IPC systems offered by most operating systems
      in that it knows how to properly copy C++ objects.</p>

    <p>This template supports all platforms supported by the synchronize component.</p>

    <p>Files: <kbd>WorkQueue.hpp</kbd>, <kbd>synchronize.hpp</kbd>, <kbd>synchronize.cpp</kbd>,
      and <kbd>environ.hpp</kbd>.</p>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract Types</h2>

<p>I define an abstract type as a class that is intended to model something from the real world or
  an encapsulation of a common software concept. Some of these abstract types use
  platform-specific functions, but they attempt to offer a platform-independent interface and can
  thus be considered "general purpose" classes. In fact, the very point of some of these classes
  is to hide system dependency behind a uniform interface.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Semaphore Classes</b></p>

    <p>These classes implement several different semaphore types with an interface that is uniform
      across Windows, OS/2, and POSIX. Currently, only the classes <code>mutex_sem</code> and
      <code>counting_sem</code> are implemented. I use the word "semaphore" loosely in this
      context to refer to a variety of flag-like objects that can be used for thread
      synchronization. There is no formal documentation at this time, but the comments in sem.h
      and sem.cpp are reasonably good.</p>

    <p>Files: <kbd>synchronize.hpp</kbd>, <kbd>synchronize.cpp</kbd>, and <kbd>environ.hpp</kbd>.
    </p>

  </li>

  <li>
    <p><b>class Timer</b></p>

    <p>This class implements a simple timer object that can be used to keep track of elapsed clock
      time. It is implemented for DOS, Windows, and POSIX. It offers subsecond resolution; the
      exact resolution depends on the abilities of the platform.</p>

    <p>Files: <kbd>Timer.hpp</kbd>, <kbd>Timer.cpp</kbd>, and <kbd>environ.hpp</kbd>. I have
      created a test program named Timer_tests.cpp that you can use to exercise this class. I
      suggest at least compiling the test program and running all the tests before trying to use
      this class in your own programs.</p>
