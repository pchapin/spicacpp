<H1 style="text-align: center;">WinDebug</H1>

<HR>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>Source level debuggers are wonderful tools. I use them myself. However, sometimes it is
  necessary to debug an application when such a tool can't be used. One such time is when an
  application malfunctions in the field but works perfectly on the developer's station. How can
  the developer get at information about a program's internal state when the program is running on
  a machine without software development tools on hand? What if the program only malfunctions when
  certain, specialized hardware is connected to the machine that the developer can't access during
  development?</p>

<p>To handle cases like this, WinDebug allows the developer to embed a small, simple debugging
  tool into the shipping application. If the application malfunctions in the field, the developer
  can work with the end user, for example, over the phone, to get insight about the program's
  operation. The developer can arrange for WinDebug to activate when certain, perhaps
  undocumented, options are selected. Then the end user can relay WinDebug's output to the
  developer, and the developer can instruct the end user in how to manipulate WinDebug.</p>

<p>Although such a debugging environment is crude, if the developer plans carefully it can be
  effective enough to give the information that is required. This is the purpose of WinDebug. It
  is not intended to replace traditional debuggers. It is intended to supplement them.</p>

<HR>
<H2>Installing WinDebug</H2>

<p>WinDebug must be compiled into your application like any other module. You need to include the
  file <code>windebug.rc</code> in your application's resource script, and you need to include the
  file <code>windebug.cpp</code> in your application's project. You also need to have the files
  <code>windebug.rh</code> and <code>windebug.ico</code> on hand. They are brought into the
  application during the build process.</p>

<p>To use WinDebug interactively, your application must call <code>create_debugWindow()</code>.
  This function causes the debugging window, a child of the desktop, to appear on the display. The
  debugging window shows the log of debug messages. The end user can interact with WinDebug by
  selecting menu items in the debugging window.</p>

<p>The debugging system is active internally even when the debugging window is not being
  displayed. The window only gives the end user a way to inspect the debug messages and adjust
  WinDebug's settings. When the window is closed, debugging information will continue to be
  collected.</p>

<HR>
<H2>Instrumenting Your Program</H2>

<p>To gain any useful information from WinDebug, you need to include debugging calls throughout
  your application. These calls are very similar in concept to the age-old method of sprinkling
  debugging <code>printf()</code> statements in a program. Except, unlike <code>printf()</code>
  statements, the output of WinDebug's debugging calls is collected in the log displayed in the
  debugging window. Such material does not interfere with the normal output of the program and can
  thus remain in the shipping version of the application.</p>

<p>There are only a few ways to instrument your program using the current version of WinDebug.</p>

<DL>

  <DT><B><code>void Tracer(int level, char *message);</code></B>

  <DD><p>Although I show <code>Tracer</code> as a function above, it is actually implemented as a
    function-like macro. It creates an object of type Tracer and passes its parameters to that
    object. In addition, it also uses the <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code> macros
    to pass the file name and line number to the underlying Tracer object.</p>

    <p>The constructor of the Tracer object logs the provided information to the debugging window.
      The message can be any string that is meaningful to you. The level is intended to represent
      the "detail level" of this trace point. A level of one is shallow. A level of, for example,
      5 would be very detailed. You can assign whatever meaning you like to the different detail
      levels. For example</p>

    <PRE>
void some_function(int X, int Y)
{
  Tracer(2, "Entered some_function()");

  // etc...
}
</PRE>

    <p>This would log a message to the debug window that looks like</p>

    <PRE>
TP: (2) Entered some_function() FILE=xyz.cpp LINE=245
</PRE>

    <p>The "TP" at the start of the line indicates that the message comes from a trace point. The
      FILE and LINE values at the end of the message represent the location in the source code
      where the Tracer object was created.</p>

  <DT><B><code>class debugstream</code></B>

  <DD><p>Class debugstream is derived from class ostringstring and supports all of ostringstream's
    behavior. In particular, you can print the values of variables into it. However, this class
    also supports a <code>say()</code> function that causes the formatted message to be logged to
    the debug window. For example</p>

    <PRE>
debugstream Message;

Message &lt;&lt; "count = " &lt;&lt; count;
Message.say(1);
</PRE>

    <p>This would log a message to the debug window that looks like</p>

    <PRE>
  : (1) count = 12
</PRE>

    <p>Here I'm assuming the value of the variable <code>count</code> was 12. This class gives you
      the functionality of debugging <code>printf()</code> in a traditional application. Note that
      <code>say()</code>'s parameter is the detail level of the message.</p>

  <DT><B><code>class notifystream</code></B>

  <DD><p>Class notifystream is basically the same as class debugstream. It is also derived from
    ostringstring and supports all of ostringstream's behavior. It also has a <code>say()</code>
    function (that takes no parameters) that causes the message formatted into it to be logged to
    the debug window.</p>

    <p>However, a notifystream is intended to process messages in exception handlers. It logs all
      messages to the debug window with an "EX" prefix and a detail level of zero. In addition, it
      displays a message box with the caption "Exception Notification" and containing the
      formatted message. In short, notifystreams give you an easy to way to display an exception
      notification to the user and log it to the debug window in a single step.</p>

</DL>

<HR>
<H2>Using the Debug Window</H2>

<p>Only 250 messages are shown in the debug window. If more messages arrive, old ones are
  discarded. In the current version of WinDebug, the number of messages buffered is not
  configurable. Each message is prefixed with a line number. This makes it easier to refer to a
  specific message and to notice new (perhaps identical) messages as they appear. The line numbers
  always advance and might go well beyond 250 during the life of the program.</p>

<p>Several debugging operations are supported on the debug window's menus. Some of the menu items
  are currently not implemented, but will be in a future version of the WinDebug.</p>

<DL>

  <DT><B><code>File|Configure</code></B> (Not implemented)

  <DD><p>This menu item brings up a dialog box that allows the user to set the desired detail
    level. Debug messages that are deeper than the current detail level are ignored. This allows
    you to get a general overview of the program's operation without getting lost in the
    details.</p>

    <p>In addition, the configuration dialog allows you to set a "start point" and "stop point"
      that defines when debug messages will be collected. This allows you to focus your attention
      on the section of the program that seems to be malfunctioning.</p>

  <DT><B><code>File|Save Buffer</code></B>

  <DD><p>This option saves the current collection of debug messages to the file you specify. You
    can use this option to make a "snapshot" of the debug log. End users can send developers such
    snapshots for detailed analysis.</p>

  <DT><B><code>File|Start Saving Log</code></B>

  <DD><p>This option allows the user to open a file on disk where debugging messages will be
    logged from then on. Unlike the "Save Buffer" option, current messages are not put into the
    disk log. However, all future messages are added to the disk log. Be careful when you use this
    option. There is no limit to the number of messages that can be saved to disk.</p>

  <DT><B><code>File|Stop Saving Log</code></B>

  <DD><p>This option turns off the disk log file feature and closes the file.</p>

  <DT><B><code>File|Exit Application</code></B> (Not implemented)

  <DD><p>This option <B>exits the entire application</B>! It is useful if the program is in a
    confused state and stopped on a WinDebug break point (break points are not yet implemented).
    Keep in mind that it is normally better to close the application using whatever method it
    defines for that purpose. To close the debug window, use the close box in the upper right
    corner of the window.</p>

</DL>

<HR>
<H2>Multithread Support</H2>

<p>WinDebug is designed to function correctly in a multithreaded program. If you are building a
  multithreaded program, be sure to #define the symbol pMULTITHREADED when compiling WinDebug. See
  the <A
      HREF="overview.html">overview document</A> for more information.</p>

<p>Multiple threads can add debug messages to the log with no danger of data corruption. Access to
  the log is synchronized between all threads that need it -- including the thread that paints the
  debug window itself.</p>
