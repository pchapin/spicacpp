//! Namespace containing the unit test manager.
/*!
 * The unit test manager is a framework for writing unit tests. It is designed to be simple to
 * use. It produces XML output that can be processed by XSLT, if necessary, before being
 * presented to the user or digested by other programs.
 * 
 * Tests are organized into suites. Each suite is registered in its entirety. When a suite is
 * executed, all tests in that suite are executed. The test manager does not support executing
 * individual tests. However, the report produced by the test manager does indicate the status
 * of each test separately.
 * 
 * This test manager is not a complete test program. Users of this framework will need to write
 * a test program that suites their needs. Minimally, it should register all required test
 * suites and then execute them. The test program may have other requirements and support
 * additional features according to the user's wishes.
 * 
 * This is a work in progress. The following is a (partial) list of enhancements that might
 * be made in the future.
 * 
 * + Currently `execute_suites` executes all registered suites. It would be nice to have the
 *   option of executing a single suite so that test programs can present that option to the
 *   user.
 * 
 * + Other output formats besides XML should be supported.
 * 
 * + Currently, if an exception is thrown in a test, the <Test> element is closed by the
 *   destructor of `UnitTest` before the <Exception> element is written. This is not ideal. It
 *   means users must know that the exception report pertains to the previous element. It would
 *   be better if the exception report was inside the <Test> element for the test that threw the
 *   exception.
 * 
 * + Currently, `test_status` returns an indication of if every test in every suite has passed
 *   or not. It would be nice to have a more detailed status that indicates the status of each
 *   suite or test separately.
 * 
 * + The output document needs to be abstracted in some way so that its state can be managed
 *   separately (for example, indentation depth, end-of-line location, etc.). Right now there
 *   is too much formatting code in the test manager itself.
 * 
 * + A test program skeleton could be provided that offers services such as, for example, a GUI
 *   or TUI, or interface with a database. Users could copy the skeleton and customize it to
 *   suit their needs.

     * \brief The type of functions that can be test suites.
     *
     * A "test suite" is just a function taking no parameters and returning bool. In the current
     * version of this framework, suite functions should always return `true`. Test failures are
     * recorded by the framework (provided the framework's macros are used), and the result is
     * made available via the `test_status` function.
     * 
     * If a suite function returns `false` a <BadReturn> element is written to the test
     * report, but it is otherwise ignored. In particular, no tests are considered to have
     * failed. Is this the right behavior?
     * 
     * When writing a suite function, a typical approach is to simply call additional functions
     * with one additional function for each test case. The suite function is then little more
     * than a sequence of function calls. However, it is up to the user of this framework to
     * decide how test suites are organized.
